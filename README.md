# my_git


1. C_plus_plus - nothing intresting. Just few tasks just seemed intresting for me;
2. M_LABS - labours "System programming in UNIX". Only ANSI C, including system calls, IPC and another Linux features;
3. My_simple_module - a charachter device module, a module for USB-device (it's neccessary to update the file, because the module for
usb-device isn't actual and there is workable usb-module for joystick. I have to load it here);
4. flex yacc - only lex files for narrow goals;
5. sys_prog - old versions of labours (2017). It's better to consider M_LABS;
6. tarantool - test task for an interview in mail ru.
